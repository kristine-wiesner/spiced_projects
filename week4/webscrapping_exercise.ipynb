One of Germany\\'s 16 constituent states, Berlin is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg, and contiguous with Potsdam, Brandenburg\\'s capital. Berlin\\'s urban area has a population of around 4.5 million and is the second most populous urban area in Germany after the Ruhr.&#91;3&#93; The Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has about six million inhabitants&#91;10&#93; and is Germany\\'s third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main regions.\\nBerlin straddles the banks of the River Spree, which flows into the River Havel (a tributary of the River Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau. Among the city\\'s main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel, and Dahme rivers (the largest of which is Lake Müggelsee). Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. About one-third of the city\\'s area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes.&#91;11&#93; The city lies in the Central German dialect area, the Berlin dialect being a variant of the Lusatian-New Marchian dialects.\\nFirst documented in the 13th century and at the crossing of two important historic trade routes,&#91;12&#93; Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417–1701), the Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1918), the German Empire (1871–1918), the Weimar Republic (1919–1933), and the Third Reich (1933–1945).&#91;13&#93; Berlin in the 1920s was the third-largest municipality in the world.&#91;14&#93; After World War II and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the city was divided; West Berlin became a de facto West German exclave, surrounded by the Berlin Wall (1961–1989) and East German territory.&#91;15&#93; East Berlin was declared capital of East Germany, while Bonn became the West German capital. Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany.\\nBerlin is a world city of culture, politics, media and science.&#91;16&#93;&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93;&#91;19&#93; Its economy is based on high-tech firms and the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, research facilities, media corporations and convention venues.&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93; Berlin serves as a continental hub for air and rail traffic and has a highly complex public transportation network. The metropolis is a popular tourist destination.&#91;22&#93; Significant industries also include IT, pharmaceuticals, biomedical engineering, clean tech, biotechnology, construction and electronics.\\nBerlin is home to world-renowned universities such as the Humboldt Universität zu Berlin (HU Berlin), the Technische Universität Berlin (TU Berlin), the Freie Universität Berlin (Free University of Berlin), the Universität der Künste (University of the Arts, UdK) and ESMT Berlin. Its Zoological Garden is the most visited zoo in Europe and one of the most popular worldwide. With the world\\'s oldest large-scale movie studio complex, Berlin is an increasingly popular location for international film productions.&#91;23&#93; The city is well known for its festivals, diverse architecture, nightlife, contemporary arts and a very high quality of living.&#91;24&#93; Since the 2000s Berlin has seen the emergence of a cosmopolitan entrepreneurial scene.&#91;25&#93;\\nBerlin contains three World Heritage Sites: Museum Island; the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin; and the Berlin Modernism Housing Estates. Other landmarks include the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag building, Potsdamer Platz, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, the Berlin Wall Memorial, the East Side Gallery, the Berlin Victory Column, Berlin Cathedral and the Berlin Television Tower, the tallest structure in Germany. Berlin has numerous museums, galleries, libraries, orchestras and sporting events. These include the Old National Gallery, the Bode Museum, the Pergamon Museum, the German Historical Museum, the Jewish Museum Berlin, the Natural History Museum, the Humboldt Forum, the Berlin State Library, the Berlin State Opera, the Berlin Philharmonic and the Berlin Marathon.&#91;26&#93;\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 History\\n\\n1.1 Etymology\\n1.2 12th to 16th centuries\\n1.3 17th to 19th centuries\\n1.4 20th to 21st centuries\\n\\n\\n2 Geography\\n\\n2.1 Topography\\n2.2 Climate\\n2.3 Cityscape\\n2.4 Architecture\\n\\n\\n3 Demographics\\n\\n3.1 Nationalities\\n3.2 Languages\\n3.3 Religion\\n\\n\\n4 Government\\n\\n4.1 City state\\n4.2 Boroughs\\n4.3 Twin towns – sister cities\\n4.4 Capital city\\n\\n\\n5 Economy\\n\\n5.1 Companies\\n5.2 Tourism and conventions\\n5.3 Creative industries\\n5.4 Media\\n\\n\\n6 Quality of life\\n7 Infrastructure\\n\\n7.1 Transport\\n\\n7.1.1 Roads\\n7.1.2 Rail\\n7.1.3 Intercity buses\\n7.1.4 Public transport\\n7.1.5 Airports\\n7.1.6 Cycling\\n7.1.7 Rohrpost (pneumatic postal network)\\n\\n\\n7.2 Energy\\n7.3 Health\\n7.4 Telecommunication\\n\\n\\n8 Education\\n\\n8.1 Higher education\\n8.2 Research\\n\\n\\n9 Culture\\n\\n9.1 Galleries and museums\\n9.2 Nightlife and festivals\\n9.3 Performing arts\\n9.4 Cuisine\\n9.5 Recreation\\n\\n\\n10 Sport\\n11 See also\\n12 Notes\\n13 References\\n\\n13.1 Citations\\n13.2 Sources\\n\\n\\n14 External links\\n\\n\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nMain article: History of Berlin\\nFurther information: Timeline of Berlin\\nEtymology[edit]\\nBerlin lies in northeastern Germany, east of the River Elbe, that once constituted, together with the River (Saxon or Thuringian) Saale (from their confluence at Barby onwards), the eastern border of the Frankish Realm. While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by Germanic tribes like the Franks and the Saxons, the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by Slavic tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear Slavic-derived names (Germania Slavica). Typical Germanized place name suffixes of Slavic origin are -ow, -itz, -vitz, -witz, -itzsch and -in, prefixes are Windisch and Wendisch. The name Berlin has its roots in the language of West Slavic inhabitants of the area of today\\'s Berlin, and may be related to the Old Polabian stem berl-/birl- (\"swamp\").&#91;27&#93; Since the Ber- at the beginning sounds like the German word Bär (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore a canting arm.\\nOf Berlin\\'s twelve boroughs, five bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: Pankow (the most populous), Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Marzahn-Hellersdorf, Treptow-Köpenick and Spandau (named Spandow until 1878). Of its ninety-six neighborhoods, twenty-two bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: Altglienicke, Alt-Treptow, Britz, Buch, Buckow, Gatow, Karow, Kladow, Köpenick, Lankwitz, Lübars, Malchow, Marzahn, Pankow, Prenzlauer Berg, Rudow, Schmöckwitz, Spandau, Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow, Steglitz, Tegel and Zehlendorf. The neighborhood of Moabit bears a French-derived name, and Französisch Buchholz is named after the Huguenots.\\n\\n12th to 16th centuries[edit]\\n  Map of Berlin in 1688\\n  Berlin Cathedral (left) and Berlin Palace (right), 1900\\nThe earliest evidence of settlements in the area of today\\'s Berlin are remnants of a house foundation dated to 1174, found in excavations in Berlin Mitte,&#91;28&#93; and a wooden beam dated from approximately 1192.&#91;29&#93; The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century. Spandau is first mentioned in 1197 and Köpenick in 1209, although these areas did not join Berlin until 1920.&#91;30&#93; The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. Cölln on the Fischerinsel is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the Spree in what is now called the Nikolaiviertel, is referenced in a document from 1244.&#91;29&#93; 1237 is considered the founding date of the city.&#91;31&#93; The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the staple right on the two important trade routes Via Imperii and from Bruges to Novgorod.&#91;12&#93; In 1307, they formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated.&#91;32&#93;&#91;33&#93;\\nIn 1415, Frederick I became the elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which he ruled until 1440.&#91;34&#93; During the 15th century, his successors established Berlin-Cölln as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the Hohenzollern family ruled in Berlin until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and eventually as German emperors. In 1443, Frederick II Irontooth started the construction of a new royal palace in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the \"Berlin Indignation\" (\"Berliner Unwille\").&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93; This protest was not successful and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. After the royal palace was finished in 1451, it gradually came into use. From 1470, with the new elector Albrecht III Achilles, Berlin-Cölln became the new royal residence.&#91;33&#93; Officially, the Berlin-Cölln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486, when John Cicero came to power.&#91;37&#93; Berlin-Cölln, however, had to give up its status as a free Hanseatic city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became Lutheran.&#91;38&#93;\\n\\n17th to 19th centuries[edit]\\nThe Thirty Years\\' War between 1618 and 1648 devastated Berlin. One third of its houses were damaged or destroyed, and the city lost half of its population.&#91;39&#93; Frederick William, known as the \"Great Elector\", who had succeeded his father George William as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance.&#91;40&#93; With the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French Huguenots.&#91;41&#93; \\nBy 1700, approximately 30 percent of Berlin\\'s residents were French, because of the Huguenot immigration.&#91;42&#93; Many other immigrants came from Bohemia, Poland, and Salzburg.&#91;43&#93;\\n\\n  Berlin became the capital of the German Empire in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years.\\nSince 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in personal union with the Duchy of Prussia. In 1701, the dual state formed the Kingdom of Prussia, as Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg, crowned himself as king Frederick I in Prussia. Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom,&#91;44&#93; replacing Königsberg. This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, \"Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin\".&#91;32&#93;\\nIn 1740, Frederick II, known as Frederick the Great (1740–1786), came to power.&#91;45&#93; Under the rule of Frederick II, Berlin became a center of the Enlightenment, but also, was briefly occupied during the Seven Years\\' War by the Russian army.&#91;46&#93; Following France\\'s victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition, Napoleon Bonaparte marched into Berlin in 1806, but granted self-government to the city.&#91;47&#93; In 1815, the city became part of the new Province of Brandenburg.&#91;48&#93;\\nThe Industrial Revolution transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city\\'s economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic center of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, neighboring suburbs including Wedding, Moabit and several others were incorporated into Berlin.&#91;49&#93; In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded German Empire.&#91;50&#93; In 1881, it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.&#91;51&#93;\\n\\n20th to 21st centuries[edit]\\nFurther information: 1920s Berlin, West Berlin, and East Berlin\\nIn the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the German Expressionist movement.&#91;52&#93; In fields such as architecture, painting and cinema new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of the First World War in 1918, a republic was proclaimed by Philipp Scheidemann at the Reichstag building. In 1920, the Greater Berlin Act incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from 66 to 883&#160;km2 (25 to 341&#160;sq&#160;mi). The population almost doubled and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the Weimar era, Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties, but also became a renowned center of the Roaring Twenties. The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government and industries. Albert Einstein rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921.\\n\\n  Berlin in ruins after World War II (Potsdamer Platz, 1945)\\nIn 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power. NSDAP rule diminished Berlin\\'s Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 as a result of emigration between 1933 and 1939. After Kristallnacht in 1938, thousands of the city\\'s Jews were imprisoned in the nearby Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Starting in early 1943, many were shipped to death camps, such as Auschwitz.&#91;53&#93; Berlin is the most heavily bombed city in history.&#91;citation needed&#93; During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed during 1943–45 Allied air raids and the 1945 Battle of Berlin. The Allies dropped 67,607 tons of bombs on the city, destroying 6,427 acres of the built up area. Around 125,000 civilians were killed.&#91;54&#93; After the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the occupation zones into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the Western Allies (the United States, the United Kingdom and France) formed West Berlin, while the Soviet sector formed East Berlin.&#91;55&#93;\\n\\n  The Berlin Wall (painted on the western side) was a barrier that divided the city from 1961 to 1989.\\nAll four Allies shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the Soviet Union imposed a blockade on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The Berlin airlift, conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.&#91;56&#93; In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in West Germany and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries\\' zones in Berlin, while the Marxist-Leninist German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin\\'s geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.\\n\\n  The fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989. On 3 October 1990, the German reunification process was formally finished.\\nThe founding of the two German states increased Cold War tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move the western powers did not recognize. East Berlin included most of the city\\'s historic center. The West German government established itself in Bonn.&#91;57&#93; In 1961, East Germany began to build the Berlin Wall around West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at Checkpoint Charlie. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany. John F. Kennedy gave his \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" speech in 1963, underlining the US support for the Western part of the city. Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a Four-Power agreement guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.&#91;58&#93;\\nIn 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the East Side Gallery preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were reunified as the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin again became a reunified city. Walter Momper, the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor of the reunified city in the interim. City-wide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first \"all Berlin\" mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring by that time, and Eberhard Diepgen (a former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.&#91;59&#93; On 18 June 1994, soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the withdrawal of allied occupation troops allowing a reunified Berlin&#91;60&#93; (the last Russian troops departed on 31 August, while the final departure of Western Allies forces was on 8 September 1994). On 20 June 1991, the Bundestag (German Parliament) voted to move the seat of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999. \\n\\n.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle .thumbcaption{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow>.thumbcaption{text-align:center}}The rebuilt Berlin Palace nearing completion, in 2020\\nBerlin\\'s 2001 administrative reform merged several boroughs, reducing their number from 23 to 12.\\nIn 2006, the FIFA World Cup Final was held in Berlin.\\nIn a 2016 terrorist attack linked to ISIL, a truck was deliberately driven into a Christmas market next to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, leaving 12 people dead and 56 others injured.&#91;61&#93;\\nBerlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) opened in 2020, nine years later than planned, with Terminal 1 coming into service at the end of October, and flights to and from Tegel Airport ending in November.&#91;62&#93; Due to the fall in passenger numbers resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, plans were announced to temporarily close BER\\'s Terminal 5, the former Schönefeld Airport, beginning in March 2021 for up to one year.&#91;63&#93; The connecting link of U-Bahn line U5 from Alexanderplatz to Hauptbahnhof, along with the new stations Rotes Rathaus and Unter den Linden, opened on 4 December 2020, with the Museumsinsel U-Bahn station expected to open around March 2021, which would complete all new works on the U5.&#91;64&#93; A partial opening by the end of 2020 of the Humboldt Forum museum, housed in the reconstructed Berlin City Palace, which had been announced in June, was postponed until March 2021.&#91;65&#93;\\n\\nGeography[edit]\\nMain article: Geography of Berlin\\nTopography[edit]\\n  Satellite image of Berlin\\nBerlin is in northeastern Germany, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat topography, part of the vast Northern European Plain which stretches all the way from northern France to western Russia. The Berliner Urstromtal (an ice age glacial valley), between the low Barnim Plateau to the north and the Teltow plateau to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last Weichselian glaciation. The Spree follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river Havel, which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the Großer Wannsee. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the Großer Müggelsee in eastern Berlin.&#91;66&#93;\\nSubstantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs Reinickendorf and Pankow lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Tempelhof-Schöneberg, and Neukölln lie on the Teltow Plateau.\\nThe borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the Arkenberge hills in Pankow at 122 meters (400&#160;ft) elevation, have been the highest point in Berlin. Through the disposal of construction debris they surpassed Teufelsberg (120.1&#160;m or 394&#160;ft), which itself was made up of rubble from the ruins of the Second World War.&#91;67&#93; The Müggelberge at 114.7 meters (376&#160;ft) elevation is the highest natural point and the lowest is the Spektesee in Spandau, at 28.1 meters (92&#160;ft) elevation.&#91;68&#93;\\n\\nClimate[edit]\\n  The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes.\\nBerlin has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb);&#91;69&#93; the eastern part of the city has a slight continental influence (Dfb), especially in the 0&#160;°C isotherm, one of the changes being the annual rainfall according to the air masses and the greater abundance during a period of the year.&#91;70&#93;&#91;71&#93; This type of climate features moderate summer temperatures but sometimes hot (for being semicontinental) and cold winters but not rigorous most of the time.&#91;72&#93;&#91;71&#93;\\nDue to its transitional climate zones, frosts are common in winter and there are larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates. Furthermore, Berlin is classified as a temperate continental climate (Dc) under the Trewartha climate scheme, as well as the suburbs of New York, although the Köppen system puts them in different types.&#91;73&#93;\\n\\nSummers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of 22–25&#160;°C (72–77&#160;°F) and lows of 12–14&#160;°C (54–57&#160;°F). Winters are cool with average high temperatures of 3&#160;°C (37&#160;°F) and lows of −2 to 0&#160;°C (28 to 32&#160;°F). Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin\\'s built-up area creates a microclimate, with heat stored by the city\\'s buildings and pavement. Temperatures can be 4&#160;°C (7&#160;°F) higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.&#91;74&#93; Annual precipitation is 570 millimeters (22&#160;in) with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Snowfall mainly occurs from December through March.&#91;75&#93; The hottest month in Berlin was July 1834, with a mean temperature of 23.0&#160;°C (73.4&#160;°F) and the coldest was January 1709, with a mean temperature of −13.2&#160;°C (8.2&#160;°F).&#91;76&#93; The wettest month on record was July 1907, with 230 millimeters (9.1&#160;in) of rainfall, whereas the driest were October 1866, November 1902, October 1908 and September 1928, all with 1 millimeter (0.039&#160;in) of rainfall.&#91;77&#93;\\n\\n\\n\\nClimate data for Berlin (Schönefeld), 1981–2010 normals, extremes 1957–present\\n\\n\\nMonth\\n\\nJan\\n\\nFeb\\n\\nMar\\n\\nApr\\n\\nMay\\n\\nJun\\n\\nJul\\n\\nAug\\n\\nSep\\n\\nOct\\n\\nNov\\n\\nDec\\n\\nYear\\n\\n\\nRecord high °C (°F)\\n\\n15.1(59.2)\\n\\n18.0(64.4)\\n\\n25.8(78.4)\\n\\n30.8(87.4)\\n\\n32.7(90.9)\\n\\n35.4(95.7)\\n\\n37.3(99.1)\\n\\n38.0(100.4)\\n\\n32.3(90.1)\\n\\n27.7(81.9)\\n\\n20.4(68.7)\\n\\n15.6(60.1)\\n\\n38.0(100.4)\\n\\n\\nAverage high °C (°F)\\n\\n2.8(37.0)\\n\\n4.3(39.7)\\n\\n8.7(47.7)\\n\\n14.3(57.7)\\n\\n19.4(66.9)\\n\\n22.0(71.6)\\n\\n24.6(76.3)\\n\\n24.2(75.6)\\n\\n19.3(66.7)\\n\\n13.8(56.8)\\n\\n7.3(45.1)\\n\\n3.3(37.9)\\n\\n13.7(56.7)\\n\\n\\nDaily mean °C (°F)\\n\\n0.1(32.2)\\n\\n0.9(33.6)\\n\\n4.3(39.7)\\n\\n9.0(48.2)\\n\\n14.0(57.2)\\n\\n16.8(62.2)\\n\\n19.1(66.4)\\n\\n18.5(65.3)\\n\\n14.2(57.6)\\n\\n9.4(48.9)\\n\\n4.4(39.9)\\n\\n1.0(33.8)\\n\\n9.3(48.7)\\n\\n\\nAverage low °C (°F)\\n\\n−2.8(27.0)\\n\\n−2.4(27.7)\\n\\n0.4(32.7)\\n\\n3.5(38.3)\\n\\n8.2(46.8)\\n\\n11.2(52.2)\\n\\n13.5(56.3)\\n\\n13.0(55.4)\\n\\n9.6(49.3)\\n\\n5.4(41.7)\\n\\n1.4(34.5)\\n\\n−1.6(29.1)\\n\\n5.0(41.0)\\n\\n\\nRecord low °C (°F)\\n\\n−25.3(−13.5)\\n\\n−22.0(−7.6)\\n\\n−16.0(3.2)\\n\\n−7.4(18.7)\\n\\n−2.8(27.0)\\n\\n1.3(34.3)\\n\\n4.9(40.8)\\n\\n4.6(40.3)\\n\\n−0.9(30.4)\\n\\n−7.7(18.1)\\n\\n−12.0(10.4)\\n\\n−24.0(−11.2)\\n\\n−25.3(−13.5)\\n\\n\\nAverage precipitation mm (inches)\\n\\n37.2(1.46)\\n\\n30.1(1.19)\\n\\n39.3(1.55)\\n\\n33.7(1.33)\\n\\n52.6(2.07)\\n\\n60.2(2.37)\\n\\n52.5(2.07)\\n\\n53.0(2.09)\\n\\n39.5(1.56)\\n\\n32.2(1.27)\\n\\n37.8(1.49)\\n\\n46.1(1.81)\\n\\n515.2(20.28)\\n\\n\\nMean monthly sunshine hours\\n\\n57.6\\n\\n71.5\\n\\n119.4\\n\\n191.2\\n\\n229.6\\n\\n230.0\\n\\n232.4\\n\\n217.3\\n\\n162.3\\n\\n114.7\\n\\n54.9\\n\\n46.9\\n\\n1,727.6\\n\\n\\nAverage ultraviolet index\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n0\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\nSource: DWD&#91;78&#93;

The city\\'s appearance today has been predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany\\'s history during the 20th century. All of the national governments based in Berlin&#160;&#8211;&#32; the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, as well as the reunified Germany&#160;&#8211;&#32; initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city\\'s architecture.\\nBerlin was devastated by air raids, fires and street battles during the Second World War, and many of the buildings that had survived in both East and West, were demolished during the postwar period. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new business or residential districts and the main arteries. Much ornamentation on prewar buildings was destroyed following modernist dogmas, and in both postwar systems, as well as in the reunified Berlin, many important heritage structures have been reconstructed, including the Forum Fridericianum along with, the State Opera (1955), Charlottenburg Palace (1957), the monumental buildings on Gendarmenmarkt (1980s), Kommandantur (2003) and also the project to reconstruct the baroque façades of the City Palace. A number of new buildings have been inspired by their historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as Hotel Adlon.\\nClusters of towers rise at various locations: Potsdamer Platz, the City West, and Alexanderplatz, the latter two delineating the former centers of East and West Berlin, with the first representing a new Berlin of the 21st century, risen from the wastes of no-man\\'s land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has three of the top 40 tallest buildings in Germany.\\nOver one-third of the city area consists of green space, woodlands and water.&#91;85&#93; Berlin\\'s second largest and most popular park, the Großer Tiergarten, is located right in the center of the city. It covers an area of 210 hectares and stretches from Bahnhof Zoo in the City West to the Brandenburg Gate in the east.\\n\\nArchitecture[edit]\\nMain article: Architecture of Berlin\\nFurther information: List of sights in Berlin and List of tallest buildings in Berlin\\n  View of Gendarmenmarkt, with the Konzerthaus Berlin to the right and the German Church in the back\\n  The Berlin Cathedral at Museum Island\\nThe Fernsehturm (TV tower) at Alexanderplatz in Mitte is among the tallest structures in the European Union at 368&#160;m (1,207&#160;ft). Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its 204-meter-high (669&#160;ft) observation floor. Starting here the Karl-Marx-Allee heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the Socialist Classicism style. Adjacent to this area is the Rotes Rathaus (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the Neptunbrunnen, a fountain featuring a mythological group of Tritons, personifications of the four main Prussian rivers and Neptune on top of it.\\nThe Brandenburg Gate is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The Reichstag building is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodeled by British architect Norman Foster in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\\nThe East Side Gallery is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city\\'s historical division.\\nThe Gendarmenmarkt is a neoclassical square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d\\'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the Französischer Dom with its observation platform and the Deutscher Dom. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\\n\\n  Charlottenburg Palace\\n  Hackesche Höfe\\nThe Museum Island in the River Spree houses five museums built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Restoration and construction of a main entrance to all museums, as well as reconstruction of the Stadtschloss continues.&#91;86&#93;&#91;87&#93; Also on the island and next to the Lustgarten and palace is Berlin Cathedral, emperor William II\\'s ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to St. Peter\\'s Basilica in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. St. Hedwig\\'s Cathedral is Berlin\\'s Roman Catholic cathedral.\\n\\n  Breitscheidplatz with Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church is the center of City West.\\nUnter den Linden is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin\\'s premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street and part of Humboldt University is there. Friedrichstraße was Berlin\\'s legendary street during the Golden Twenties. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today\\'s Berlin.\\nPotsdamer Platz is an entire quarter built from scratch after the Wall came down.&#91;88&#93; To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the Gemäldegalerie, and is flanked by the Neue Nationalgalerie and the Berliner Philharmonie. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, a Holocaust memorial, is to the north.&#91;89&#93;\\nThe area around Hackescher Markt is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the Hackesche Höfe, a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby New Synagogue is the center of Jewish culture.\\nThe Straße des 17. Juni, connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east–west axis. Its name commemorates the uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the Siegessäule (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia\\'s victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\\nThe Kurfürstendamm is home to some of Berlin\\'s luxurious stores with the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at its eastern end on Breitscheidplatz. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is KaDeWe, claimed to be continental Europe\\'s largest department store. The Rathaus Schöneberg, where John F. Kennedy made his famous \"Ich bin ein Berliner!\" speech, is in Tempelhof-Schöneberg.\\nWest of the center, Bellevue Palace is the residence of the German President. Charlottenburg Palace, which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.\\nThe Funkturm Berlin is a 150-meter-tall (490&#160;ft) lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant 55&#160;m (180&#160;ft) and an observation deck 126&#160;m (413&#160;ft) above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\\nThe Oberbaumbrücke over the Spree river is Berlin\\'s most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 Berlin U-Bahn line. The bridge was completed in a brick gothic style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge, with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the Red Army from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a checkpoint and border crossing between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\\n\\nDemographics[edit]\\nMain article: Demographics of Berlin\\n  Berlin\\'s population, 1880–2012\\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75&#160;million registered inhabitants&#91;2&#93; in an area of 891.1&#160;km2 (344.1&#160;sq&#160;mi).&#91;1&#93; The city\\'s population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km2. Berlin is the most populous city proper in the European Union. In 2019, the urban area of Berlin had about 4.5&#160;million inhabitants.&#91;3&#93; As of 2019&#91;update&#93; the functional urban area was home to about 5.2&#160;million people.&#91;90&#93; The entire Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has a population of more than 6&#160;million in an area of 30,546&#160;km2 (11,794&#160;sq&#160;mi).&#91;91&#93;&#91;1&#93;\\nIn 2014, the city state Berlin had 37,368 live births (+6.6%), a record number since 1991.

In 1685, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in France, the city responded with the Edict of Potsdam, which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The Greater Berlin Act in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9&#160;million to 4&#160;million.\\nActive immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Berlin is home to at least 180,000 Turkish and Turkish German residents,&#91;2&#93; making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey. In the 1990s the Aussiedlergesetze enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former Soviet Union. Today ethnic Germans from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community.&#91;93&#93; The last decade experienced an influx from various Western countries and some African regions.&#91;94&#93; A portion of the African immigrants have settled in the Afrikanisches Viertel.&#91;95&#93; Young Germans, EU-Europeans and Israelis have also settled in the city.&#91;96&#93;\\nIn December 2019, there were 777,345 registered residents of foreign nationality and another 542,975 German citizens with a \"migration background\" (Migrationshintergrund, MH),&#91;2&#93; meaning they or one of their parents immigrated to Germany after 1955. Foreign residents of Berlin originate from about 190 different countries.&#91;97&#93; 48 percent of the residents under the age of 15 have migration background.&#91;98&#93; Berlin in 2009 was estimated to have 100,000 to 250,000 unregistered inhabitants.&#91;99&#93; Boroughs of Berlin with a significant number of migrants or foreign born population are Mitte, Neukölln and Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg.&#91;100&#93;\\nThere are more than 20 nonindigenous communities with a population of at least 10,000 people, including Turkish, Polish, Russian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Serbian, Italian, Bosnian, Vietnamese, American, Romanian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Chinese, Austrian, Ukrainian, French, British, Spanish, Israeli, Thai, Iranian, Egyptian and Syrian communities.&#91;citation needed&#93;\\n\\nLanguages[edit]\\nMain articles: German language and Berlinerisch dialect\\nGerman is the official and predominant spoken language in Berlin. It is a West Germanic language that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. German is one of 24 languages of the European Union,&#91;101&#93; and one of the three working languages of the European Commission.\\nBerlinerisch or Berlinisch is not a dialect linguistically, but has features of Lausitzisch-neumärkisch dialects. It is spoken in Berlin and the surrounding metropolitan area. It originates from a Brandenburgish variant. The dialect is now seen more as a sociolect, largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak standard German in everyday life.\\nThe most-commonly-spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, Polish, English, Arabic, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, French, Spanish and Vietnamese. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish and Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part, due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. Polish, English, Russian, and Vietnamese have more native speakers in East Berlin.&#91;102&#93;\\n\\nReligion[edit]\\nMain article: Religion in Berlin\\nClockwise from top left: Berlin Cathedral, New Synagogue, Şehitlik Mosque, and St. Hedwig\\'s Cathedral\\nAccording to the 2011 census, approximately 37 percent of the population reported being members of a legally-recognized church or religious organization. The rest either did not belong to such an organization, or there was no information available about them.&#91;103&#93;\\nThe largest religious denomination recorded in 2010 was the Protestant regional church body—the Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia (EKBO)—a United church. EKBO is a member of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) and Union Evangelischer Kirchen (UEK). According to the EKBO, their membership accounted for 18.7 percent of the local population, while the Roman Catholic Church had 9.1 percent of residents registered as its members.&#91;104&#93; About 2.7% of the population identify with other Christian denominations (mostly Eastern Orthodox, but also various Protestants).&#91;105&#93; According to the Berlin residents register, in 2018 14.9 percent were members of the Evangelical Church, and 8.5 percent were members of the Catholic Church.&#91;2&#93; The government keeps a register of members of these churches for tax purposes, because it collects church tax on behalf of the churches. It does not keep records of members of other religious organizations which may collect their own church tax, in this way.\\nIn 2009, approximately 249,000 Muslims were reported by the Office of Statistics to be members of Mosques and Islamic religious organizations in Berlin,&#91;106&#93; while in 2016, the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel estimated that about 350,000 Muslims observed Ramadan in Berlin.&#91;107&#93; In 2019, about 437,000 registered residents, 11.6% of the total, reported having a migration background from one of the Member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.&#91;2&#93;&#91;108&#93; Between 1992 and 2011 the Muslim population almost doubled.&#91;109&#93;\\nAbout 0.9% of Berliners belong to other religions. Of the estimated population of 30,000–45,000 Jewish residents,&#91;110&#93; approximately 12,000 are registered members of religious organizations.&#91;105&#93;\\nBerlin is the seat of the Roman Catholic archbishop of Berlin and EKBO\\'s elected chairperson is titled the bishop of EKBO. Furthermore, Berlin is the seat of many Orthodox cathedrals, such as the Cathedral of St. Boris the Baptist, one of the two seats of the Bulgarian Orthodox Diocese of Western and Central Europe, and the Resurrection of Christ Cathedral of the Diocese of Berlin (Patriarchate of Moscow).\\nThe faithful of the different religions and denominations maintain many places of worship in Berlin. The Independent Evangelical Lutheran Church has eight parishes of different sizes in Berlin.&#91;111&#93; There are 36 Baptist congregations (within Union of Evangelical Free Church Congregations in Germany), 29 New Apostolic Churches, 15 United Methodist churches, eight Free Evangelical Congregations, four Churches of Christ, Scientist (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 11th), six congregations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an Old Catholic church, and an Anglican church in Berlin. Berlin has more than 80 mosques,&#91;112&#93; ten synagogues,&#91;113&#93; and two Buddhist temples.\\n\\nGovernment[edit]\\nMain articles: Politics of Berlin and Berlin Police\\nCity state[edit]\\n  Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall), seat of the Senate and Mayor of Berlin\\nSince reunification on 3 October 1990, Berlin has been one of the three city states in Germany among the present 16 states of Germany. The House of Representatives (Abgeordnetenhaus) functions as the city and state parliament, which has 141 seats. Berlin\\'s executive body is the Senate of Berlin (Senat von Berlin). The Senate consists of the Governing Mayor (Regierender Bürgermeister) and up to ten senators holding ministerial positions, two of them holding the title of \"Mayor\" (Bürgermeister) as deputy to the Governing Mayor.&#91;114&#93; The total annual state budget of Berlin in 2015 exceeded €24.5 ($30.0) billion including a budget surplus of €205 ($240) million.&#91;115&#93; The state owns extensive assets, including administrative and government buildings, real estate companies, as well as stakes in the Olympic Stadium, swimming pools, housing companies, and numerous public enterprises and subsidiary companies.&#91;116&#93;&#91;117&#93;\\nThe Social Democratic Party (SPD) and The Left (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the 2001 state election and won another term in the 2006 state election.&#91;118&#93; Since the 2016 state election, there has been a coalition between the Social Democratic Party, the Greens and the Left Party.\\nThe Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the City of Berlin (Oberbürgermeister der Stadt) and Minister President of the State of Berlin (Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes). The office of the Governing Mayor is in the Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall). Since 2014 this office has been held by Michael Müller of the Social Democrats.&#91;119&#93;\\n\\nBoroughs[edit]\\nMain article: Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin\\n  Berlin\\'s 12 boroughs and their 96 neighborhoods\\nBerlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs or districts (Bezirke). Each borough has a number of subdistricts or neighborhoods (Ortsteile), which have roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. These subdistricts became urbanized and incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with their neighborhoods, colloquially called Kiez. At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.\\nEach borough is governed by a borough council (Bezirksamt) consisting of five councilors (Bezirksstadträte) including the borough\\'s mayor (Bezirksbürgermeister). The council is elected by the borough assembly (Bezirksverordnetenversammlung). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough\\'s mayors make up the council of mayors (Rat der Bürgermeister), which is led by the city\\'s Governing Mayor and advises the Senate. The neighborhoods have no local government bodies.\\n\\nTwin towns – sister cities[edit]\\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany\\nBerlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.&#91;120&#93; Town twinning between Berlin and other cities began with its sister city Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin\\'s partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification but later partially reestablished. West Berlin\\'s partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the Western World, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the Warsaw Pact and its allies.\\nThere are several joint projects with many other cities, such as Beirut, Belgrade, São Paulo, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Johannesburg, Mumbai, Oslo, Shanghai, Seoul, Sofia, Sydney, New York City and Vienna. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World\\'s Major Cities, and Conference of the World\\'s Capital Cities. \\nBerlin is twinned with:&#91;120&#93;\\n\\n.mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col-rules{column-rule:1px solid #aaa}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}\\n Los Angeles, United States (1967)\\n  Madrid, Spain (1988)\\n  Istanbul, Turkey (1989)\\n  Warsaw, Poland (1991)\\n  Moscow, Russia (1991)\\n  Brussels, Belgium (1992)\\n  Budapest, Hungary (1992)\\n  Tashkent, Uzbekistan (1993)\\n  Mexico City, Mexico (1993)\\n  Jakarta, Indonesia (1993)\\n  Beijing, China (1994)\\n  Tokyo, Japan (1994)\\n  Buenos Aires, Argentina (1994)\\n  Prague, Czech Republic (1995)\\n  Windhoek, Namibia (2000)\\n  London, United Kingdom (2000)\\n\\nSince 1987, Berlin also has an official partnership Paris, France.

The President of Germany, whose functions are mainly ceremonial under the German constitution, has their official residence in Bellevue Palace.&#91;122&#93; Berlin is the seat of the German Chancellor (Prime Minister), housed in the Chancellery building, the Bundeskanzleramt. Facing the Chancellery is the Bundestag, the German Parliament, housed in the renovated Reichstag building since the government\\'s relocation to Berlin in 1998.
